Ruwiki %RV#%
------------
Ruwiki is a simple, extensible Wiki-clone written in Ruby. It supports both
CGI and WEBrick interfaces, templates, and CSS formatting. This Wiki differs
from most other Wikis in that it supports project namespaces, so that two
topics may be named the same for differing projects without colliding or
having to resort to odd naming conventions. Please see the ::Ruwiki project in
the running Wiki for more information. Ruwiki %RV#% has German and Spanish
translations available.

Upgrading
---------
Ruwiki %RV#% has a flatfile format that is incompatible with older versions of
Ruwiki. If you are upgrading from one of these versions, you must use the
bin/convert. The simple case will be (assuming that your data files are in
./data):

  % convert ./data

The convert utility is automatically installed by RubyGems.

Requirements
------------
Ruwiki currently requires:
  * Ruby 1.8
  * Diff::LCS 1.2.0
  * Archive::Tar::Minitar 0.5.1

The YAML backend requires Ruby 1.8.2 after preview2. You should have been
prompted to load these dependencies on installation.

Quick Start (WEBrick Readonly)
------------------------------
1. Type:

   % ruwiki_servlet --gem-data

2. Point your web browser to <http://localhost:8808/>.

Quick Start (CGI)
-----------------
1. Create a directory in a place that your webserver can execute CGI programs
   and type:

   % ruwiki install cgi,data --to <directory>

2. Ensure that ruwiki.cgi is executable on your webserver.
3. Point your web browser to the appropriate URL.

Quick Start (WEBrick)
---------------------
1. Create a directory to store your data and templates and type:

   % ruwiki install data --to <directory>

2. Type:

   % ruwiki_servlet

3. Point your web browser to <http://localhost:8808/>.

Configuration
-------------
There are extensive configuration options available. The Ruwiki WEBrick
servlet offers command-line options that simplify the configuration of Ruwiki
without editing the servlet; use ruwiki_servlet --help for more information.
