page!content:	= Ruwiki
	Ruwiki is a simple, extensible Wiki written in Ruby. It supports both
	CGI and \WEBrick interfaces, templates, and CSS formatting.
	Additionally, it supports project namespaces, so that two pages can be
	named the same for differing projects without colliding or odd naming
	conventions. Please see the ::Ruwiki project for more information.
	
	Ruwiki is also an internationalised Wiki, although more testing,
	especially testing with multibyte character encodings and Unicode
	(UTF-8) is required. There are German and Spanish localisations of the
	messages included with the Ruwiki distribution.
	
	The current version is %RV#%. Enhancements and changes include:
	* a deployment system, whereby Ruwiki deployments can be installed from a package manager like that used for RPA (rpa-base) or \RubyGems (see Ruwiki::RuwikiUtilities);
	* support for Ruwiki as a Windows service on NT, 2000, XP, and 2003 systems;
	* demotion of YAML and Marshal storage types to formats of the Flatfiles storage type;
	* external user authentication (currently to \RubyForge only);
	* antispam efforts including robot and IP exclusion and URL redirection (see Ruwiki::[[Antispam]]); and
	* protection against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks with HTML and CSS cleaning.
	The full list of changes can be found in Ruwiki::ChangeLog, with
	discussions of various features in Ruwiki::WikiMarkup,
	Ruwiki::Configuring_Ruwiki, and Ruwiki::Extending_Ruwiki.
	
	If you are upgrading from a version of Ruwiki older than 0.8.0, please
	read Ruwiki::RuwikiUtilities.
	
	Certain Ruwiki \APIs are considered stable at this point, others will
	be changing leading up to 1.0. Some of this is discussed in
	Ruwiki::To_Do, with further architectural discussions in
	Ruwiki::[[Roadmap]].
