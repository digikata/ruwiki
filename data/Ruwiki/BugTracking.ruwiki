page!content:	= Ruwiki %RV#% Bug Tracking
	This page is for tracking bugs in Ruwiki. Only bugs from recent
	distributions are tracked. In addition to this source-based bug
	tracking, there is the [http://rubyforge.org RubyForge]
	[http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?atid=407&group_id=84&func=browse bug
	tracker] for Ruwiki.
	
	Those interested in Ruwiki development may also find the Ruwiki::To_Do
	list and the Ruwiki::[[Roadmap]] useful. The format of the bug list is
	&ldquo;version: description&rdquo;.
	
	== Open Bugs
	The version number is the version in which the bug was first reported.
	* 0.6.2: Not all formatting is applied consistently. The token rankings may need adjusting. Eivind Eklund has suggested a scheme that may help with this, but it will require architectural adjustment and will probably slow things down.
	
	----
	== Closed Bugs
	The version number is the version in which the bug was fixed.
	* 0.9.0: Fixed a problem with old page edits being applied inappropriately.
	* 0.8.0: [http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=707&group_id=84&atid=407 Sub-Numbered bullets don&rsquo;t increment]. Fixed a list numbering problem. I think that lists are a bit slower now, but they are completely accurate.
	* 0.7.0: Fixed a link detection problem in \[wikiword] format. Thanks to [mailto:eivind@FreeBSD.org Eivind Eklund] for the patch.
	* 0.7.0: Fixed a problem with &lt;pre&gt; paragraph detection and generation.
	* 0.7.0: Fixed a problem with &lt;p&gt; generation.
	* 0.7.0: [http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=197&group_id=84&atid=407 Run-away ruby on some links in default distribution]. This may be related to a runaway header problem that was reported to me on IRC some time back that I believe has been fixed. Please advise.
	* 0.6.1: Projects aren&rsquo;t created appropriately.
	* 0.6.1: Saving without editing (or repost) appears to cause problems. A fix has been applied to attempt to address this. Pages that have not been changed will not be saved.
