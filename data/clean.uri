# This file contains the list of URIs or partial URIs that will not be
# redirected by the automatic redirection technique. It is recommended that the
# Regular Expression be specific and be anchored to prevent "similar" URIs from
# being handled poorly. Non HTTP/HTTPS URIs are not redirected at this time.
#
# This file is in "extended" regular expression format, one optional expression
# to a line. Spaces are not significant and comments are allowed. If you want
# to recognise a space in your regular expression, do so either with a
# character class ([ ]) or the whitespace meta-character (\s). Hash marks must
# be escaped (\#) or they will be treated as comment markers. Blank or
# comment-only lines are ignored. All other lines will be joined together:
#
#       ^http://[^/]*?ruby-lang.org/?.*$
#       ^http://[^/]*?rubyforge.org/?.*$
#
# becomes:
#
#       %r{^http://[^/]*?ruby-lang.org/?.*$|^http://[^/]*?rubyforge.org/?.*$}
